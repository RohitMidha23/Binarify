## What is Binarify
Binarify is a python script that lets you convert any image to a binary image resembling the input image.
In other words, it replicates an image with 1's and 0's.



## How to use Binarify

1. Clone this repository.
2. Typical usage often looks like :
```
  python binarify.py -input path/to/image.jpg -output path/to/output/text/file -mode black -width 120
```
3. Check the output.txt file for the text version of the same.
